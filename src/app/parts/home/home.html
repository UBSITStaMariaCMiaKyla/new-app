<h3>Course Overview</h3>

<p>
This course introduces Angular, a powerful and widely used open-source front-end framework 
developed and maintained by Google. Angular is built with TypeScript and is designed to help 
developers create dynamic, responsive, and scalable single-page web applications (SPAs) 
using modern web development practices.
</p>

<p>
Throughout this course, students will learn how Angular simplifies application development 
by providing a structured framework, reusable components, and efficient tools for handling 
user interfaces, data binding, routing, and state management. Angular’s modular architecture 
allows developers to build applications that are easy to maintain, test, and extend over time.
</p>

<p>
The course covers both fundamental and practical concepts, including components, modules, 
services, directives, dependency injection, and HTTP communication. Students will also gain 
hands-on experience working with Angular’s command-line interface (CLI), enabling them to 
generate, configure, and manage projects efficiently.
</p>

<p>
By the end of this course, learners will be able to design and develop modern web applications 
that follow industry best practices. Whether you are building small interactive websites or 
large enterprise-level applications, Angular provides a reliable and scalable platform to 
support real-world development needs.
